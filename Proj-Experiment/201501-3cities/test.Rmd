This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(animation)
saveGIF({
  ani.options(nmax = 30)
  brownian.motion(pch = 21, cex = 5, col = "red", bg = "yellow")
}, interval = 0.05, movie.name = "bm_demo.gif", ani.width = 600, ani.height = 600)
```
